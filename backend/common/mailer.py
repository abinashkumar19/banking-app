"""Minimal SMTP mailer shared by any service that needs to send email
(currently just users-service, for OTP codes).

Credentials never live in the repo. They're set as GitHub Environment
secrets, injected into a k8s Secret named `app-secrets` by
.github/workflows/deploy.yml at deploy time, and mounted into the pod as
plain env vars - see k8s/services/users-deployment.yaml.

Only two secrets are required:
  SMTP_USER           the Gmail address that logs in to send, e.g. you@gmail.com
  SMTP_APP_PASSWORD   a Gmail app password (NOT your normal account password) -
                       Google Account -> Security -> 2-Step Verification -> App passwords

Everything else has a sane default and doesn't need to be set:
  SMTP_HOST           defaults to smtp.gmail.com
  SMTP_PORT           defaults to 587 (STARTTLS)
  SMTP_FROM_EMAIL     defaults to SMTP_USER
  SMTP_FROM_NAME      defaults to "Cloud Bank"

If SMTP_USER / SMTP_APP_PASSWORD are missing, send_email logs and no-ops
instead of raising, so services degrade gracefully in environments (like
local dev) where mail isn't configured.
